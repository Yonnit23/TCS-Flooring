      <p>Each type of flooring material has its own unique benefits. To choose the best types of flooring for your home, first assess the needs of each room. From there, you can select between the wide range of flooring options by matching your style preferences to the size of your budget.</p>

<section id="vinyl">
  <h3>Types of Vinyl Flooring</h3>
  <img src="images/vinyl.jpg" alt="vinyl flooring" />
  <p>Vinyl flooring is extremely durable and cost-effective. Itâ€™s made from plastic, usually consisting of acrylic, PVC and similar polymers. It's a budget-friendly option for homeowners who want luxurious style and commercial grade durability. Vinyl flooring is available in planks, sheets or tiles. Since it is scratch- and stain-resistant and waterproof, vinyl flooring is both functional and stylish.</p>
</section>

<section id="tile">
  <h3>Types of Tile Flooring</h3>
  <img src="images/tile.jpg" alt="tile flooring" />
  <p>Tile flooring is perfect for high-moisture rooms that have the potential to get wet, like bathrooms, laundry rooms and basements. Tiles are versatile and can last for many years with little maintenance required. Many tile textures are available that can mimic wood, stone or even fabric.</p>

<section id="laminate">
  <h3>Types of Laminate Flooring</h3>
  <img src="images/laminate.jpg" alt="laminate flooring" />
  <p>Laminate flooring delivers the look of real wood, tile or stone flooring at a budget-friendly price. However, laminate usually requires less maintenance than these traditional types of flooring. Scratch-resistant, waterproof, noise-resistant and heated options are available in a variety of attractive, easy-to-install styles. For these reasons, laminate flooring has become a popular choice in many homes.</p>

<section id="hardwood">
  <h3>Types of Hardwood Flooring</h3>
  <img src="images/hardwood.jpg" alt="hardwood flooring" />
  <p>Hardwood flooring is durable and provides a timeless, elegant look. Certain types of hardwood floors can be refinished up to five times, and you can change the sheen to match a newly decorated room. Area rugs make easy, attractive additions to rooms with hardwood floors. While hardwood flooring requires a higher upfront investment, many homeowners choose it for its longevity and beauty.</p>
  <p>There are two basic types of hardwood flooring. Solid hardwood flooring consists of boards milled from a single piece of solid wood. Engineered hardwood flooring consists of a multi-layer base (made of compressed wood, resin and polymers) with real hardwood on the surface. It can be more budget-friendly than solid hardwood.</p>

<section id="carpet">
  <h3>Carpet Flooring</h3>
  <img src="images/carpet.jpg" alt="carpet flooring" />
  <p>Carpet is of course a great choice for rooms where you want extra warmth and comfort underfoot, such as bedrooms and family rooms. Choose your type of carpet based on the room's level of foot traffic, as some carpet textures and piles are more durable than others. There are a few primary types of carpet and a wide variety of materials available.</p>
